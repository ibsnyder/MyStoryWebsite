        <p> The first picture is of me and my sister Maddy. We are five years apart and she is probably my best friend. The middle picture is of my cousin Rylee and I. My cousin is one year younger than me and we have been pretty close ever since we when young. The last photo, the one on the right, is a picture of my parents and my sister. I took this picture almost exactly a year ago in Costa Rica.
